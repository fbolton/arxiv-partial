Note that the qiskit_ibm_runtime namespace is actually provided in the qiskit-ibm-runtime Python package, which makes it hard for the package manager to find automatically. To add manually, either go to your package manager and search for qiskit-ibm-runtime or add qiskit-ibm-runtime to your 'requirements.txt' file.

Note also that qiskit.BasicAer backend is provided by the qiskit-aer Python package.
